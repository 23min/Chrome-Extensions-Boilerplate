Samples:
--------

### GRE Testing

This sample chrome extensions helps you study for the GRE in your browswer while you surf the net. Just a simple sample that I was thinking of while I was uselessly browsing the YouTubes.

### Simple Twitter

This example ties into the Twitter UI by simplifying it. It essentially dynamically creates a link to a stylesheet in the <head> so that certains styles are overrident to make the experience a bit simpler. Nothing too complicated, but helps demonstrate how you can use extensions to create a more desirable experience for you and others.
